# Allstar

## Project Objective

Welcome to Allstar! Allstar are a new gym francise who have set up facilities in the Dublin City area. They require a new website that targets customers with attractive design and vivid imagery. 

The website design I have chosen is clear and concise, and provides sufficient information to satisfy the curiousity of prospective members. This information can be easily obtained due to the intuitive layout of the page. It utilises striking colors and appealing imagery to catch the users attention.

## UX

### Website Design Goals

- A striking landing page with design matching the business's brand
- A website that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices
- Vivid imagery to capture the imagination of website visitors
- Information regarding gym facilities, classes and trainers
- Smooth intuitive navigation elements to assist user experience
- Information regarding contact details, site locations and a contact form option
- Member testemonials
- Social media links

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find out what these gyms have available at their facilities. I want to know what kind of gym this is as well as the clientele I can expect to find here.
- As a user, I want to find information regarding classes as well as associated times. I want to find out quickly as I would like to work classes into my busy schedule.
- As a user, I want to research pricing and policy information. I will be looking to see if there are any deals available.
- As a user, I want to see images that show off the gyms interior. I want to imagine myself there and how comfortable I may or may not feel.
- As a user, I want to be able to see testemonials from people who are already members. I can trust a business more if I can see reviews from real customers.
- As a user, I want to find out if one of the gyms are near me. If one is and I can find it quickly I will have greater interest in becoming a member.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact a member of staff, if the need arises, directly from the website. If I left something behind I will have piece of mind to know I can get in touch quickly and can avoid a phonecall.
- As a user, I want the website to motivate me to join and to start working out and better myself.
- As a user, I want to be able to intuitively move around the site, as I am only browsing and am not really looking for anything in particular.

### Site Owner Goals

- To advertise our presence within the Dublin area
- To attract new members

### Design Choices

I went with a design that aims to empower the potential gym user, to invoke strong emotions of confidence and inner strength. I want potential customer to view this website as a portal to becoming the best they can be. This requires a blend of strong dark colors blended with bright striking ones to add a visual flair. 

#### Fonts

For fonts I browsed [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom) for a good strong title and heading font as well as a font suited for detailed information. I chose [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) for my strong title font as I felt it gives headlines a punchy, standout look. This pairs well with [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom) which I used for all paragraph text. Roboto is easily legible and should aid with accessibility as it allows for a more natural reading rhythm.

#### Icons

I used some free icons available on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) to enhance and draw attention to certain sections of the page. The appropriate icons coincide with the topic being discussed in the text, such as using a dumbell when talking about gym equipment. Soical media icons are used instead of urls for asthetic enhancement. These icons are also styled alongside all other elements of the page so they blend seemlessly without sticking out. The navigation is also designed to shrink into a hamburger button when the page is using mobile screen format.

#### Colors

For colors I went with a blend of light and dark colors. Lighter colors are primarily used for text and icon elements while the darker colors provide the background that allows the text elements to pop. I will go into greater detail, color by color, below the image.

![Allstar-color-pallete](https://github.com/JMuckian94/Allstar-Gyms-MS1/blob/master/AllstarColorPal.png "Allstar-Color-Pallete")

- #981F29 Ruby Red: This color will be used for 
- #090446 Midnight Blue: This color will be used for
- #4361EE Ultramarine Blue: This color will be used for
- #494947 Davys Grey: This color will be used for
- #FFFFFF: This color will be used for primarily text elements as it will stand out best on dark backgrounds.

Work in progress

#### Structure

I chose to utilise [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the overall structure of the website. It allowed me to have all my content in responsive row/column sections on the page. These sections can also adapt to various screen sizes. Bootstrap can also provide some basic CSS and Javascript functionality so it is a great way to assemble the skeleton of the page before custom styling begins.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq's](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9YWDBhDyARIsADt6sGbn1ZOXBiFtGYsZKhw_Vn14WS0VrUxu8nj3vnZ_2fwGqf4FdsBoB20aAosXEALw_wcB) trial software to create my wireframe mockups. I started with the desktop design so I could figure out how best to utilise the space available. I then scaled down my designs to better fit tablet and mobile platforms. For overall design, I went with a single page website as my skills are limited to static mobile designs at this point in my learning journey. As mentioned before, the nav bar will assist in quickly scrolling to the desired area of the page.

Here are the links to my wireframes:

## Features

### Navigation

I used Bootstrap to create a responsive searchbar that will adapt to the platform the user is viewing the website from. Since this is a single page site design I have opted for a sticky navbar. This will give the user greater agility and help them identify the relevant information sooner. This navbar will convert to a hamburger icon on mobile devices to avoid crowding. I have also implemented the Bootstrap scroll spy feature, to remind the user where they are currently on the page, by highlighting the appropriate heading in the navbar.

### Hero Image Slideshow

The hero image slideshow will act as an initial impression maker for any first time visitors, adding some dynamism to an otherwise static website. This section will use a rotation of images to give users a quick taste of the gyms atmosphere. The slideshow is configured to occupy 100% screen width and to adjust height to the appropriate size for each viewing platform.

### Promotional Jumbotron

Here I have added a Bootstrap jumbotron to announce the current promotion on offer with Allstar Gyms. It will include the announcement message, some special pricing information, and a sign up button. All text will be centered and custom styled with CSS.

### Reviews

I have added a reviews section, positioning it using the Bootstrap grid system. On Desktop, I have aligned the first members image to the left the second to right while centering the review text. I wanted to minimise unused space in this area. On tablet,  both review images are aligned left with text aligned right. On mobile, the reviews section is configured to hide the images and only display the review text. This is to avoid crowding.

### FAQs

For this section, I went for the Bootstrap accordian feature to organise the FAQs, making them easier to use and navigate. The initial framework is constructed in HTML using Bootstrap and then styled further in CSS. "+" and "-" symbols provided by FontAwesome add addtional visual indicators to assist accessiblility.
