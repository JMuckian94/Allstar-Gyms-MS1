# Allstar

## Project Objective

Welcome to Allstar! Allstar are a new gym francise who have set up facilities in the Dublin City area. They require a new website that targets customers with attractive design and vivid imagery. 

The website design I have chosen is clear and concise, and provides sufficient information to satisfy the curiousity of prospective members. This information can be easily obtained due to the intuitive layout of the page. It utilises striking colors and appealing imagery to catch the users attention.

## UX

### Website Design Goals

- A striking landing page with design matching the business's brand
- A website that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices
- Vivid imagery to capture the imagination of website visitors
- Information regarding gym facilities, classes and trainers
- Smooth intuitive navigation elements to assist user experience
- Information regarding contact details, site locations and a contact form option
- Member testemonials
- Social media links

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find out what these gyms have available at their facilities. I want to know what kind of gym this is as well as the clientele I can expect to find here.
- As a user, I want to find information regarding classes as well as associated times. I want to find out quickly as I would like to work classes into my busy schedule.
- As a user, I want to research pricing and policy information. I will be looking to see if there are any deals available.
- As a user, I want to see images that show off the gyms interior. I want to imagine myself there and how comfortable I may or may not feel.
- As a user, I want to be able to see testemonials from people who are already members. I can trust a business more if I can see reviews from real customers.
- As a user, I want to find out if one of the gyms are near me. If one is and I can find it quickly I will have greater interest in becoming a member.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact a member of staff, if the need arises, directly from the website. If I left something behind I will have piece of mind to know I can get in touch quickly and can avoid a phonecall.
- As a user, I want the website to motivate me to join and to start working out and better myself.
- As a user, I want to be able to intuitively move around the site, as I am only browsing and am not really looking for anything in particular.

### Design Choices

I went with a design that aims to empower the potential gym user, to invoke strong emotions of confidence and inner strength. I want potential customer to view this website as a portal to becoming the best they can be. This requires a blend of strong dark colors blended with bright striking ones to add a visual flair. 

#### Fonts

For fonts I browsed [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom) for a good strong title and heading font as well as a font suited for detailed information. I chose [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) for my strong title font as I felt it gives headlines a punchy, standout look. This pairs well with [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Strong&preview.text_type=custom) which I used for all paragraph text. Roboto is easily legible and should aid with accessibility as it allows for a more natural reading rhythm.

#### Icons

I used some free icons available on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) to enhance and draw attention to certain sections of the page. The appropriate icons coincide with the topic being discussed in the text, such as using a dumbell when talking about gym equipment. Soical media icons are used instead of urls for asthetic enhancement. These icons are also styled alongside all other elements of the page so they blend seemlessly without sticking out. The navigation is also designed to shrink into a hamburger button when the page is using mobile screen format.

#### Colors

For colors I went with
